This is a small place on the internet.
There is no rush here, only the quiet passing of time.

Sometimes a short note is enough:
to remember a day,
to mark a season,
to notice that you were here.

<Callout title="A note to self">
  Start with one clear thought. Complex sections are useful only when they make
  the writing clearer.

Thank you for visiting.
