I used to think English progress came from finding better materials.
So I kept collecting videos, articles, and apps, but I was still quiet when it was time to speak or write.
My turning point was simple: stop optimizing input, start producing output every day.

  leftItems="I consumed a lot and practiced very little.||I waited until I felt ready, so I postponed speaking.||I measured effort by hours watched, not ideas expressed."
  rightItems="I keep input short and purposeful.||I write and speak every day, even when imperfect.||I measure progress by clarity, confidence, and consistency."

<SectionBreak label="Daily Process" />

<Flow nodes="Pick one small topic from daily life||Read or watch one short piece of input||Write 5-8 sentences in my own words||Record a 1-2 minute speaking note||Review mistakes and rewrite once" />

<Steps items="Morning warm-up::Read one paragraph out loud and shadow pronunciation for 10 minutes.||Midday writing::Write a short journal entry using new words from the morning.||Evening speaking::Record a short reflection and compare it to last week's recordings.||Weekly review::Collect repeated mistakes and create a tiny correction list for next week." />

  For the next 90 days, I will keep the same routine and increase speaking time
