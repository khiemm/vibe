excerpt: "How I moved from passive input to daily output with a simple routine."

So I kept collecting videos, articles, and apps, but I was still quiet when it was time to speak or write.
My turning point was simple: stop optimizing input, start producing output every day.

For the next 90 days, I will keep the same routine and increase speaking time from 2 minutes to 5 minutes per day.
