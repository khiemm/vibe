# Personal Website

A minimal personal website built with Next.js.

The site focuses on atmosphere rather than features:
calm visual rhythm, spacious layouts, typography-first design, subtle motion.

To keep the codebase stable and prevent over-engineering, two guiding files are used:

- PLAN.md — constraints & architecture boundaries
- PROMPTS.md — reusable prompt templates for AI-assisted work

---

## Philosophy

This website intentionally prioritizes:

- minimalism
- calm visual rhythm
- spacious layouts
- typography-first design
- subtle motion

If a design decision feels excessive, choose the simpler option.

## Project Rules

### PLAN.md

`PLAN.md` defines the boundaries of the project:

- purpose & scope
- allowed tech stack
- what must NOT be introduced
- design principles
- rules AI agents must follow

Think of `PLAN.md` as the constitution of the project.

### PROMPTS.md

`PROMPTS.md` contains prompt templates for AI tools.

Templates include placeholders wrapped in brackets:

\[like this\]

Replace the bracketed text with your specific task before sending the prompt.

## Working Style (Suggested)

- Prefer small, incremental changes
- Keep components readable and explicit
- When in doubt: reduce, simplify, remove
